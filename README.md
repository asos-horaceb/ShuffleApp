 Prince's Trust - Get Into Technology  2016
 
 
Business Requirements
=========

Scenario/User Story: 
---------

As a customer, I want a quick and easy way to see a small selection of relevant New In items on the home page, so I don’t have to make a search or click on a category before I can get new season style inspiration. 

Business value:
---------

Based on analytics, customers regularly click through directly to product pages from fashion news pages and blogs. ASOS put 4000 new styles on site every week, we need an easy route for customers to access them. Currently the ASOS home page only has images linking through to categories where the customer has to do “work” before finding items they might buy. Featuring a few individual items from the New In category on the home page will showcase the latest styles to customers with an easy minimum click route and may increase conversion, especially with new visitors who are unfamiliar with the site.
